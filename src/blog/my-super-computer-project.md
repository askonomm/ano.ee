At the time of writing this, I use a 2021 14" Macbook Pro with 16GB of memory and a M1 Pro chip both for personal use and for work. And it works wonders. It's extremely fast, has a beautiful screen and everything is responsive and nice.

But, I want **more**. A lot more. And I want future-proofing, so I wouldn't have to spend over 2000€ to get an upgraded processor, GPU or RAM. And I want to play games. Thus, I will be building my very own computer. I've never done this before, I barely know anything about the inner-workings of a computer, and so I'll have a friend helping me who does know about this stuff.

## Parts

Before I can assemble anything, I need to get all the parts, and this is the list of things I will be getting:

- [ ] [Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BFJHP26/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) (85€)

- [x] [Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FW85VFT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_9?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1) (100€)

- [ ] [GPU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09GS84DK9/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=A2Z0UEWQG9GV6N&psc=1) (805€)

- [ ] [PSU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079H5WNXN/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A3W58OWURERN0R&th=1) (122€)

- [x] [Storage 1TB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08V83JZH4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_5?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) (92€)

- [ ] [RAM 4 x 32gb](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-VENGEANCELPX64GB-PC4-28800-C181-35V-Desktop/dp/B07YV9VYYY/) (578€)

- [ ] [CPU cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BY6F8D9/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) (83€)

- [ ] [Processor](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5950X-32-Thread-Processor/dp/B0815Y8J9N/ref=psdc_229189_t2_B08164VTWH) (544€)

Total cost: **€2409**. A 128GB memory (max that this motherboard supports), 16 core processor, 8GB video machine for the price of a MacBook. Not bad. And I can upgrade all the parts however I wish, should I have the need to do so.

I will be updating this post once I have all the parts.

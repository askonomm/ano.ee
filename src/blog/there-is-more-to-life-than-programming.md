title: There's more to life than programming
description: How I've grown tired and bored of programming as a hobby and discovered motorcycles.

Lately I've been sort of distant with online stuff. I have a bunch of open source projects, things I've been wanting to build, things I've been wanting to improve, and no desire to do anything. Many times I've fired up my editor after work, only to close it a few minutes later. The pen seems to have run out of ink. Maybe I've turned into a 9-5 developer who barely touches a computer outside of work hours? Well, if we're being honest, would anybody care if I did? 

The more onwards this software career of mine marches, the more difficult the job tends to get. Or rather, the more I get to work on areas I've never been able to before, making me feel a spectrum of feelings between dumb and smart almost every day. And I think I've reached a point now after 11 years in this industry where this is enough. I don't need side projects to scratch the itch that didn't get scratched at work anymore. Maybe it's time for a new hobby, one that I don't also do for money?

This summer I bought myself a 50cc moped, [Romet Ogar 202](/images/rometogar202.jpeg). I wanted something that is a motorcycle, but doesn't require a license to drive (because I don't have one). And thus a moped, which is identical to a motorcycle in pretty much every way except the small engine size, was perfect. I also wanted something cheap (and this one is fairly cheap coming in at around 1800â‚¬) so that I could learn how motorcycle mechanics work and experiment with stuff without it costing a fortune.

Besides it being fun to drive around, I've learnt how to change filters and oil, fine tune gas and clutch cables, strengthen the chain, and learnt what all (well, most, some stuff on it are ungoogleable chinese things) the parts do on the machine. I even considered buying a bigger cylinder to replace the one in my tiny engine to make it go a wee-bit faster, but opted not to as it would break the engine quicker. I bought a 125cc engine which I'll be trying on it soon enough, and I think I should get an additional frame support welded on it because currently the engine just hangs from the frame, which I read can, over time, malform the frame.

What I'm trying to say is, I guess, that I really enjoy this stuff. A new frontier to discover. I don't make any money with it, only lose money, but I truly enjoy tinkering on something physical with my bare hands, and enjoying the result on open roads. I have no idea if this newfound hobby persists, all I know is that there's more to life than programming, and I'm eager to explore it. And if this truly turns out to be the end of programming as a hobby for me then so be it, we had a good decade long run. This is nothing to be sad about, this is to be celebrated.
